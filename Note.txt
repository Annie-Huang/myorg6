==========================================================


Using Nx to Scale your React Development

Two Aspects of Scaling:
1. Tech (making it fast)
2. Org (letting many team work in the same repo)

Nx - Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos

Highlights:
1. A mighty general purpose metadata-driven CLI (with editor support)
	- How does it compare to the CLIs you know and use?
2. Monorepos features
	- Distributed computation memoization
	- Code change anlysis
	- How does it compare to Lerna and Yarn Workspaces


C:\react>npx create-nx-workspace@next --preset=react

C:\react\myorg6>nx e2e shop-e2e --watch
If you look at workspace.json:
    "shop-e2e": {
      "architect": {
        "e2e": {...},
        "lint": {...}
        }
      }
You can see e2e is a target for shop-e2e.
